# Implement Application Security Groups

In Azure, you can use Application Security Groups (ASGs) to logically group your virtual machines (VMs) based on workloads and then define network security group (NSG) rules accordingly. ASGs provide an application-centric approach to managing your infrastructure.

## Key Points about Application Security Groups

- ASGs function similarly to NSGs but offer a way to view your infrastructure based on applications.
- VMs are associated with ASGs, and you can use these groups as sources or destinations in NSG rules.

## Implementing ASGs: An Example Scenario

Let's explore how to implement ASGs through an example scenario of an online retailer. Here are the scenario requirements:

1. Six virtual machines: Two web servers and two database servers.
2. Customer access to the online catalog via web servers over HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
3. Inventory information stored on database servers, accessible over HTTPS (port 1433).
4. Only web servers should have access to the database servers.

## Solution

To address these requirements, follow these steps:

1. Create application security groups for the virtual machines:
   - Create an ASG named "WebASG" to group the web servers.
   - Create an ASG named "DBASG" to group the database servers.

2. Assign network interfaces (NICs) to the appropriate ASGs:
   - For each VM, assign its NIC to the corresponding ASG.

3. Create the network security group (NSG) and define security rules:
   - Rule 1 (Priority: 100): Allow access from the internet to VMs in the "WebASG" group over HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
   - Rule 2 (Priority: 110): Allow access from VMs in the "WebASG" group to VMs in the "DBASG" group over HTTPS (port 1433).
   - Rule 3 (Priority: 120): Deny (X) access from anywhere to VMs in the "DBASG" group over HTTPS (port 1433).

Rules 2 and 3 ensure that only the web servers can access the database servers, providing a secure configuration to protect inventory databases from external threats.

## Advantages of Using Application Security Groups

- Simplified IP address maintenance: ASGs eliminate the need to configure specific IP addresses in security rules, making it easier to manage changing server configurations.

- No subnets required: ASGs allow you to organize VMs by application and purpose without the need to distribute them across specific subnets.

- Simplified rules: ASGs reduce the complexity of security rule sets. You can apply new rules dynamically to designated ASGs, automatically affecting all VMs within the group.

- Workload support: ASGs provide a logical organization of your applications, services, data storage, and workloads, making configuration and management straightforward.

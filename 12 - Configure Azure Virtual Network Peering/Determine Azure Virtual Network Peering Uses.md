# Azure Virtual Network Peering

Azure Virtual Network peering is a quick and easy way to connect your virtual networks in Azure. It allows you to link two Azure virtual networks seamlessly, making them function as one network for connectivity.

## Types of Azure Virtual Network Peering

- **Regional Peering**: Connects Azure virtual networks within the same region.
- **Global Peering**: Connects Azure virtual networks in different regions.

## Usage Considerations

- Regional peering can be used within the same Azure public cloud region, China cloud region, or Microsoft Azure Government cloud region.
- Global peering can be used across various Azure public cloud regions or China cloud regions.
- Global peering is not allowed between Azure Government cloud regions.

## Key Benefits

- **Private Network Connections**: Traffic between peered virtual networks stays private on the Microsoft Azure backbone network, eliminating the need for public internet, gateways, or encryption.
- **Strong Performance**: Azure Virtual Network peering ensures low-latency, high-bandwidth connections between resources in different virtual networks.
- **Simplified Communication**: Resources in one virtual network can easily communicate with those in another once they are peered.
- **Seamless Data Transfer**: You can use Azure Virtual Network peering to transfer data across Azure subscriptions, deployment models, and regions.
- **No Resource Disruptions**: Creating or using Azure Virtual Network peering doesn't require downtime for resources in either virtual network.

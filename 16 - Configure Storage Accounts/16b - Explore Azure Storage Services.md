# Explore Azure Storage Services

**Objective:** Azure Storage offers four data services that can be accessed through an Azure storage account. These services are designed to cater to various storage needs.

## Key Services

### Azure Blob Storage (containers)

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's cloud-based object storage solution. It excels at handling massive amounts of unstructured or non-relational data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is suitable for various use cases, including:

- Serving images or documents directly to web browsers.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Data backup, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Data analysis by on-premises or Azure-hosted services.

Objects in Blob Storage can be accessed globally via HTTP or HTTPS. Access can be achieved through URLs, Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure Storage client libraries available in languages like .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Ruby.

### Azure Files

Azure Files allows the creation of highly available network file shares, accessible through the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and Network File System (NFS) protocol. Multiple virtual machines can access these file shares for both reading and writing. Files can also be accessed through the REST interface or storage client libraries.

Common use cases for Azure Files include:

- Migrating on-premises applications that use file shares to Azure with minimal changes.
- Storing configuration files for multiple virtual machines.
- Managing tools and utilities shared among developers.
- Storing diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps for later processing.

Authentication for file share access is handled through storage account credentials, granting read/write access to users with the share mounted.

### Azure Queue Storage

Azure Queue Storage is used to store and retrieve messages. Each queue message can be up to 64 KB in size, and queues can accommodate millions of messages. Queues are employed to manage lists of messages that need asynchronous processing.

Consider a scenario where customers upload pictures, and you want to create thumbnails for each image. Instead of making customers wait for thumbnail creation during upload, you can use a queue. After the upload, a message is added to the queue, and an Azure Function retrieves it to create thumbnails. This approach allows separate scaling of processing components for better control.

### Azure Table Storage (Azure Cosmos DB)

Azure Table Storage is a fully managed NoSQL database service suitable for modern app development. It offers automatic management, updates, and patching, as well as capacity management options like serverless and automatic scaling based on application needs.

In addition to the existing Azure Table Storage service, there's a new Azure Cosmos DB Table API that provides throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes.

## Considerations for Choosing Azure Storage Services

When planning your Azure Storage configuration, consider the following:

- **Storage Optimization:** Azure Blob Storage is optimized for massive unstructured data storage. It's suitable for serving data to web browsers, streaming, and backup.

- **High Availability:** Azure Files provides highly available network file shares, easing the migration of on-premises applications. Storage account credentials ensure proper authentication.

- **Message Storage:** Use Azure Queue Storage for storing a large number of messages, commonly used for asynchronous processing.

- **Structured Data:** Azure Table Storage is ideal for structured, non-relational data. It offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. Azure Cosmos DB Table API enhances these features for modern app development.

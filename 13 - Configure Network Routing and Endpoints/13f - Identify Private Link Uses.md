# Azure Private Link

Azure Private Link provides secure and private connectivity from a virtual network to various Azure services, customer-owned services, or Microsoft partner services. It simplifies network architecture and enhances security by eliminating exposure to the public internet.

## Key Features of Azure Private Link

- **No Public Internet Access**: Azure Private Link ensures that all traffic stays within the Microsoft global network, eliminating public internet access.

- **Global Reach**: It's a global service with no regional restrictions, allowing private connectivity to services in different Azure regions.

- **Private Endpoints**: Azure Private Link enables you to bring Azure services into your private virtual network by mapping it to a private endpoint.

- **Customer Services**: You can use Private Link to privately deliver your own services to your customer's virtual networks.

- **Simple Routing**: All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, without the need for gateways, NAT devices, Azure ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or public IP addresses.

## Using Azure Private Link

Azure Private Link simplifies network routing and ensures secure connectivity. For instance, it connects to a network security group (NSG) private endpoint via Azure SQL Database, preventing a direct connection.

## Considerations for Using Azure Private Link

- **Private Connectivity**: Connect privately to services across Azure regions, keeping traffic on the Microsoft network without public internet access.

- **Integration Options**: Easily integrate with on-premises and peered networks by accessing private endpoints over private peering or VPN tunnels, eliminating the need for public peering or internet access.

- **Data Protection**: Enhance security by mapping private endpoints to Azure PaaS resources, ensuring that only mapped resources are accessible in the event of a security incident, preventing data exfiltration.

- **Service Delivery**: Privately consume Azure PaaS, Microsoft partner services, and your own services in your virtual networks, simplifying the experience across Azure AD tenants and streamlining requests and approvals.

Azure Private Link provides robust security and connectivity options for various scenarios, making it a valuable tool for your network architecture.
